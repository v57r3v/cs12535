1.    [25 points] Remind yourself of   the terminology we developed in Chapter   1 for causal   questions.    Suppose   we   are   interested   in   the   causal   effect   of having   health   insurance   on   an   individual’s   health   status.
(a)    [5   points]   We   run   a   phone   survey   where   we   ask   5,000   respondents   about   their   current   insurance   and   health   conditions.   The   data   we   collect   is   an   example   of   a   .
(b)    [5 points] The   US   government   has   Census   data   onevery   elderly   American’s   current   insurance   and health   status.   This   is   an   example   of data   for   the   .
(c)    [5   points]   Suppose   we   take   our   phone   survey   data   and   calculate   the   difference   in   health   between   individuals   who   do   and   do   not   have   insurance.   This   difference   is   an   example   of   an   _______.
(d)    [5   points]   The   difference   in   health   between   all   Americans   who   do   and   don’t   have   insurance   is   an example   of   an   _______.    The   effect   of   insurance   on   health   is   an   example   of   a   _______.
(e)    [5 points] When   the   two   objects   in   (d)   coincide,we   have   an   example   of   .    Give   one   reason why   the   two   objects   in   (d)   might   not   coincide.
2.    [35   points]   Let   Y   = a + X3   /b   where   a   and   b   are   some   constants   with   b   > 0,   and   where   X   ∼   N(0, 1).
(a)    [2   points]   State   the   definition   of the   cumulative   density   function   of   Y   ,   which   we’llcall   Fa,b   (y).

(b)    [5   points]   Express   Fa,b   (y)   in   terms   of   the   CDF   of   the   standard   normal   distribution   Φ(·).    Hint: can   you   re-write   the   inequality   Y ≤ y   as   an   inequality   involving   X? 
(c)    [3   points]   Express   E[Y]   in   terms   of   E[X3],   then   use   the   fact   that   E[X3]   =   0   when   X   ∼   N(0, 1)   to   derive   E[Y].
(d)    [4   points]   Express   Cov(Y,   X)   in   terms   of   E[X4],   then   use   the   fact   that   E[X4]   =   3   when   X   ∼  代 写ECON 4211 Problem Set #1 Spring 2025
代做程序编程语言 N(0, 1) to   derive   Cov(Y,   X).
(e)    [2   points]   Suppose   E[Y] = 0   and   Cov(Y,   X) =   0.3.    What   can   you   conclude   about   a   and   b?
(f)    [6   points]   Given   your   answers   to   (b)   and   (e),   what   is   the   probability   that   a   draw   of   Y   is   bigger than   zero?   What   is   the   probability   that   a   draw   of   Y   falls   between   −0.1   and   0.1?
(g)    [3   points]   Let   W   =   a + X3   /b + Z   where   Z   is   mean-zero   and   independent   of   X   .      How   does   the
distribution   of E[W   | X]   (recall   this   is   a   random   variable)   compare   to   the   distribution   of   Y?3.    [40   points]   In   this   problem,   we   will   talk   about   how   to   estimate   the   variance   of   a   random   variable   X   ,
σX(2),   with   an   iid   sample   of n   observations.   Recall   that   the   definition   of variance   is
σX(2)   = E[(Xi   −   µX   )2] 
Note   that   to   use   this   estimator,   you   need   to   know   µX .    However,   we   rarely   (or   never)   know   the   true value   of   µX .   This   implies   one   has   to   use   some   sort   of   replacement   for   µX .    A   seemingly   natural   option
is to   use  as an   estimator   for   µX .
(a)    [7   points]   Show   that  is   an   unbiased   estimator.    Is   it   consistent?    What   law   would   you   use   to prove   that?
(b)    [7˜ points]   Suppose   that   somebody   gave   you   the   advice   of using   the   following   estimator:  and said that this estimator is more efficient. Is this claim true?
(c)    [7   points]   Suppose   you   decided   to   use   the   formula   below   to   estimate   sample   variance:

which   can   be   conveniently   rewritten   as

Show   that

(d)    [7   points]   Show   that

Hint:   think   about   the   variance   of the   sample   mean   (computed   in   class).
(e)    [6   points]   Using   (d),calculate   E[˜(σ)X(2)].
(f)    [6   points]   Is   the   estimator   ˜(σ)X(2)      unbiased?    If   not,   calculate   the   bias   of   this   estimator   and   propose an   unbiased   estimator.
